            <h2>Offender Health</h2>

            <p>
            At F Stott Healthcare we are committed to delivering a healthcare
            service comparable to a standard of care delivered within the
            community to offenders.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the prisons we work collaboratively with all the healthcare
            team to provide prisoners a safe environment to access the help
            and advice they require from a professional service.
            </p>

            <p>
            Many people within the justice system experience greater problems
            than the rest of the population but do not regularly access timely
            healthcare. A priority in services for this group of patients is
            improving continuity of care.
            </p>

            <p>
            Children and young people in contact with the Youth Justice System
            often have complex unmet health needs due to lack of screening.
            </p>

            <p>
            Prisons can provide an opportunity to address serious health
            inequalities and break cycles of disadvantage.

          <h2>Domiciliary Care</h2>
            <p>
            The domiciliary eye examination is available for patients who are unable to attend a practice unaccompanied due to physical or mental disability.
            </p>
            <p>
            Domiciliary eye care simply means eye care at home. If you cannot get to a High Street optician on your own, F Stott Healthcare can come visit you in the comfort of your own home. We have specialist equipment to enable us to provide an accurate sight test in your home.
            </p>
            <p>
            A sight test checks whether you need glasses or contact lenses to help you see better. Having the right glasses or contact lenses can often increase your independence and improve your well-being, and can even help prevent falls. But a sight test is also an important eye-health check, and can sometimes detect signs of underlying general health conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
            </p>
            <p>     
            Everyone should have a sight test every two years, or more often if your optometrist recommends it.
